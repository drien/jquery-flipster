jQuery.Flipster
===============
[![](http://api.libscore.com/badge/$.fn.flipster.svg)](http://libscore.com/#$.fn.flipster)

Flipster is a CSS3 3D transform-based jQuery plugin built to replicate the familiar 'cover flow' effect, but also supports a variety of styles. Not only is it gorgeous to look at, Flipster is also:

- **Responsive**: From desktop to mobile, Flipster automatically centers and scales to fit the area provided.
- **Lightweight**: Javascript and CSS combined are only 5kb gzipped (13kb uncompressed). Only dependency is jQuery.
- **Touch/Scrollwheel/Trackpad/Keyboard Friendly** Swipe on touch devices, scroll via trackpad or mousewheel, and use your arrow keys to fly through items!
- **Flexible:** Flip an image gallery or any HTML content. Links and dynamic content work great!
- **Customizable:** Four built in styles (coverflow, carousel, wheel and flat) with plenty of options to configure Flipster the way you want.

Basic Usage
---------------

**Step 1**: Include Flipster's CSS, typically in the `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/flipster.min.css">
```
*Tip: Use the un-minified `flipster.css` or the LESS files in the `src/less` folder to make your own Flipster styles!*

**Step 2**: Set up your content:
```html
<div class="my-flipster">
  <ul>
    <li><img src="" /></li>
    <li><p>Plain ol' <abbr>HTML</abbr>!</p></li>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

*Tip: Set the `itemContainer` and `itemSelector` options to fit your markup. Flipster only requires an outer container and inner container; you aren't restricted to `<div>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`s. *

**Step 3**: Include Flipster's Javascript after jQuery (ideally at the bottom of the page before the `</body>` tag) and initialize Flipster on your element:
```html
<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/jquery.flipster.js"></script>
<script>
    $('.my-flipster').flipster();
</script>
```

**Step 4**: Start flippin'!


Options
---------------

Configure your options when first initializing Flipster. Default values and descriptions are shown below.
```javascript  
$('.my-flipster').flipster({
    itemContainer: 'ul',
    // [string|object]
    // Selector for the container of the flippin' items.

    itemSelector: 'li',
    // [string|object]
    // Selector for children of `itemContainer` to flip

    start: 'center',
    // ['center'|number]
    // Zero based index of the starting item, or use 'center' to start in the middle

    fadeIn: 400,
    // [milliseconds]
    // Speed of the fade in animation after items have been setup

    loop: true,
    // [true|false]
    // Loop around when the start or end is reached

    autoplay: false,
    // [false|milliseconds]
    // If a positive number, Flipster will automatically advance to next item after that number of milliseconds

    pauseOnHover: true,
    // [true|false]
    // If true, autoplay advancement will pause when Flipster is hovered

    style: 'coverflow',
    // [coverflow|carousel|flat|...]
    // Adds a class (e.g. flipster--coverflow) to the flipster element to switch between display styles
    // Create your own theme in CSS and use this setting to have Flipster add the custom class

    spacing: -0.6,
    // [number]
    // Space between items relative to each item's width. 0 for no spacing, negative values to overlap

    keyboard: true,
    // [true|false]
    // Enable left/right arrow navigation

    scrollwheel: true,
    // [true|false]
    // Enable mousewheel/trackpad navigation; up/left = previous, down/right = next

    touch: true,
    // [true|false]
    // Enable swipe navigation for touch devices

    nav: false,
    // [true|false|'before'|'after']
    // If not false, Flipster will build an unordered list of the items
    // Values true or 'before' will insert the navigation before the items, 'after' will append the navigation after the items

    navButtons: false, // v0.4
    buttons: false, // v1.0
    // [true|false]
    // If true, Flipster will insert Previous / Next buttons

    prevText: 'Previous',
    // [text|html]
    // Changes the text for the Previous button

    nextText: 'Next',
    // [text|html]
    // Changes the text for the Next button

    onItemSwitch: false
    // [function]
    // Callback function when items are switched
    // Arguments received: [currentItem, previousItem]
});
```

Methods
---------------

Once an element has been initialized with Flipster, you can call methods to control it:

```javascript
var myFlipster = $('.my-flipster').flipster(); // It's best to store the element as a variable for easy reference.

myFlipster.flipster('next'); // Next item
myFlipster.flipster('prev'); // Previous item
myFlipster.flipster('jump', 0); // Jump to a specific index
myFlipster.flipster('jump', $('.my-item')); // Jump to a specific item
myFlipster.flipster('play'); // Resume autoplay
myFlipster.flipster('play', 5000); // Set autoplay duration
myFlipster.flipster('pause'); // Pause the autoplay
myFlipster.flipster('index'); // If items are added or removed, you can tell Flipster to reindex 
```

Navigation
---------------

Set `nav: true` in the options and Flipster can build an unordered list of links to each item to let users jump around. 

The navigation list will use each item's `data-flip-title` attribute as the text. If an item does not have a `data-flip-title`, Flipster will try to grab the `title` attribute, or will default to the item's index.

```html
<div class="my-flipster">
    <ul>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 1 Title">...</li>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 2 Title">...</li>
        ...
    </ul>
</div>
```

***Tip:** Flipster 

## Categories

Include `data-flip-category` attributes on your items, and the navigation list will group items into categories, allowing for basic filtering and quicker navigation.

```html
<div class="my-flipster">
    <ul>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 1 Title" data-flip-category="Category 1">...</li>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 2 Title" data-flip-category="Category 1">...</li>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 3 Title" data-flip-category="Category 2">...</li>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 4 Title" data-flip-category="Category 2">...</li>
        <li data-flip-title="Item 5 Title">...</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
